# [↑](#table-of-contents) TVDB API v3 — Endpoint Catalog (Placeholder)

TVDB API v3 is considered legacy and has been superseded by the v4 API for most use cases.  
This file is a placeholder and can be populated later if you need a full v3 endpoint reference for migration work.

---

## Status

- TVDB v3 is **deprecated / legacy**.
- TVDB v4 is the recommended API for new integrations.
- See **[`mapping.md`](./mapping.md)** for v3 → v4 equivalence and migration notes.

---

## To-Do

- Add full v3 endpoint list when/if required.
- Cross-link each v3 endpoint to its v4 equivalent (where applicable).
- Add notes for endpoints that have no v4 replacement.
